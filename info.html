      <h2 dir="lrt">Course Description</h2>
      <p><strong>Internet and advances in technology allow us to collect massive amounts of diverse types of data. There is an increasing recognition that data could be translated into valuable insights. A data scientist is a person who has the skills, knowledge, and ability to extract actionable knowledge from the data -- either for the good of society, advancement of science, or profit in business. This class is an introduction to the practice of data science. The student will leave the class with a broad set of practical skills for doing data science including collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing data, exploring the data, applying methods from machine learning to analyze the data, and communicating the results. The students will gain experience in dealing with “big data,” which are too big to fit in the computer’s memory.</strong>
