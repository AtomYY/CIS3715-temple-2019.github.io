    "When it comes to model sequential data such as sentences, documents and videos, etc, the state of the art approach is to use Recurrent neural network (RNN). At each timestep, RNN takes an element (such as a word) as input, combines with past information encoded as a vector (such as all information in the sentence before this timestep), generate a new vector encoding both current input and past information, then delivers it to next timestep.\n",
